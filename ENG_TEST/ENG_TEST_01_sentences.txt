Not great, really.
The homework was too hard.
Did you have many friends there?
Only one or two, but the teachers were nice.

So where are the wedding cars?
The groom's already at the church and we're going to be late.
I can't believe it.
Don't worry, they'll be here in a minute.
I'm sure they've just...
I can't help being worried.
It's not every day my daughter gets married.
She's my daughter too.
Look, here they come now.
OK.

OK?
Hi Dad, I'm back.
Oh good.
So how was the swimming lesson then?
OK, but you know, 8 o'clock on a Saturday morning.
It's so early.
But at least you have the rest of the day to do other things, like go to town with your friends and shop for new clothes.
Oh Dad.
Anyway, how was it?
Well, there were three of us in the class.
The teacher told us to swim really fast and gave a t-shirt to the winner of the race.
And was it fun?
Yeah, actually.
I really like trying to win.
And I'm good, you know.
Yes, I know.
Your teacher told me.
I need a new swimming costume too.
Why?
What's wrong with the one you have?
It's a bit too small for me.
OK, so we'll go to the shops tomorrow and get you a new one.
Now, where's your towel?
Oh, sorry Dad.
I think I left it in the changing room at the pool.
Oh Susan, you're hopeless.
Hi Dad, I'm back.

Do you want to do some clothes shopping or something?
No, I've got to get some earrings.
What more?
You've got so many.
No Dad, they're for Jenny.
It's her birthday on Friday.
I see.
OK.
Where do you want to get them from?
That little place opposite the bookshop.
You know, next to the chemist's.
Oh yes, I know.
Oh wait a minute.
I'm back late tomorrow.
I've got a meeting at three so I'll get the 4.15 train.
So I should be back here at five.

Hello.
Can I help you?
Please.
I'm looking for a hotel.
But I don't have much money to spend.
There are no hotels in this small village, I'm afraid.
Just people's houses.
In the next town, there's a big hotel on the beach, but that's very expensive.
And there are some new villas there too, overlooking the sea.
Are you travelling alone?
No.
I'm with a friend.
She's just coming.
All we need is a room for a few days.
We can find you a room, no problem.
My job is to help tourists.
Look, that's my office over there.
OK.
So could you just tell me how much a room costs?
Not too much.
About 20 euros.
What?
Per person?
No, for the room.
And if you stay for a week, it's even cheaper.
Maybe 120.
Oh, that sounds OK.
Have you got anything near the beach?
Yes.
I can find you something, no problem.
and then I can show you some places and see if we can find you something that you like.

Can I return these ones, please?
Yes, certainly.
Thank you.
Was there anything else?
Well, I ordered a book last week.
Can you check if it's arrived yet?
Sure.
Can I have your library card, please?
I just have to find your details on the computer.
Sorry.
The computer's being a bit slow.
That's all right.
No, sorry.
It's not here yet.
Oh.
Also, do you have anything happening for children this week?
Yes.
We have story time at 2pm this Friday.
It's for the under fives.
How much does it cost?
Oh, it's free for members.
And while that's on, mums and dads can look around our exhibition of local history.
That's great.
We'll come back on Friday then.

Good afternoon.
May I help you, madam?
Yes, please.
I'd like to go on holiday next week.
To the sunshine.
No problem.
Any country in mind?
Somewhere nice and warm, that's all.
How about this hotel in Egypt?
The weather's lovely right now.
That looks great, but a little expensive for me, I think.
Hmm.
How about this apartment in Italy?
Tuscany.
That looks wonderful.
Can I go next week?
I'm sorry.
It's not available for another month.
Never mind.
Anything in Spain or Greece?
There's this small hotel in Spain.
What do you think?
That looks great.
It's right on the beach.
And you can go next week.
Perfect.
And not too expensive.
No.
Then I'll take it.
Thanks so much for your help.

I'm a photographer.
I do a lot of work at home.
I usually get up at 6 o'clock and go for a run.
When I get home, I have a shower and then I eat breakfast.
At half past eight, my children go to school and my wife leaves for work.
At 9 o'clock, I sit down at my computer and start my work.
First, I read and send emails.
I advertise my photos on my website.
I make lots of people buy them from there.
At about 10.30, I take my camera and go for a walk.
I live in the country and there are a lot of beautiful places to photograph.
I sometimes go for meetings in London.
On those days, I leave home early in the morning.
I enjoy my job very much and I think I always will.

This is Petra Harris with a programme announcement.
On Wednesday evening, we have a special programme from Africa.
Brian Williams is a reporter and he lived there with a group of elephants for six months.
This is his story.
There are some sad moments.
For example, when Jemma, a baby elephant, dies.
But there are happy moments too.
We see the elephants in the water playing like children.
It wasn't easy for Brian because the sun was very strong and sometimes he didn't have water.
He had a lot of help from the African people.
One man, Charlie, was with him all the time and is now his best friend.
So don't miss this programme.
Everyone who loves animals will enjoy it.
