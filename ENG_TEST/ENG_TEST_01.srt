1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,660
What was your first school like?

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,136
Not great, really.

3
00:00:08,136 --> 00:00:10,370
The homework was too hard.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,020
Did you have many friends there?

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,830
Only one or two, but the teachers were
nice.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,060
What was your first school like?

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,582
Not great, really.

8
00:00:24,582 --> 00:00:26,780
The homework was too hard.

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,480
Did you have many friends there?

10
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,260
Only one or two, but the teachers were
nice.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:44,810
Shall we buy some oranges and bananas?

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,190
OK, if you want.

13
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,730
And the mangoes look nice too.

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,750
Shall we get one?

15
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,890
Yeah, I don't mind.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,480
Hey, look at the strawberries.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:56,880
Do you want some?

18
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh yes, I love them.

19
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,700
Alright, let's get half a kilo.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,900
Shall we buy some oranges and bananas?

21
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,300
OK, if you want.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,826
And the mangoes look nice too.

23
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:10,860
Shall we get one?

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,000
Yeah, I don't mind.

25
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,610
Hey, look at the strawberries.

26
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,210
Do you want some?

27
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,070
Oh yes, I love them.

28
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,970
Alright, let's get half a kilo.

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,840
Let's meet for lunch.

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,980
I can do Saturday, next Tuesday or
Wednesday.

31
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,055
Ah, I can't do Saturday.

32
00:01:34,055 --> 00:01:36,320
That's my brother's birthday.

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,280
What about next week then?

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,080
OK, Tuesday's fine.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
Let's meet for lunch.

36
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,940
I can do Saturday, next Tuesday or
Wednesday.

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,040
Ah, I can do Saturday, next Tuesday or
Wednesday.

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,340
I can't do Saturday, that's my brother's
birthday.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,340
What about next week then?

40
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,140
OK, Tuesday's fine.

41
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,980
Is it true that Mark is a vegetarian?

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,080
Yes, now he mainly eats salads, fruit and
vegetables.

43
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,110
But he used to love eating meat.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,210
He won't touch it, but he still eats a bit
of fish.

45
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
Is it true that Mark is a vegetarian?

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,720
Yes, now he mainly eats salads, fruit and
vegetables.

47
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,720
Yes, now he mainly eats salads, fruit and
vegetables.

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,720
But he used to love eating meat.

49
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,720
He won't touch it, but he still eats a bit
of fish.

50
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,440
So where are the wedding cars?

51
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,440
The groom's already at the church and
we're going to be late.

52
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,440
I can't believe it.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Don't worry, they'll be here in a minute.

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
I'm sure they've just...

55
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,940
I can't help being worried.

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,940
It's not every day my daughter gets
married.

57
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,217
She's my daughter too.

58
00:03:01,217 --> 00:03:02,440
Look, here they come now.

59
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,440
OK.

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,700
So where are the wedding cars?

61
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,800
The groom's already at the church and
we're going to be late.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't believe it.

63
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
Don't worry, they'll be here in a minute.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,800
I'm sure they've just...

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,300
I can't help being worried.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,300
It's not every day my daughter gets
married.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,577
She's my daughter too.

68
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,800
Look, here they come now.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,800
OK?

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
Hi Dad, I'm back.

71
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,865
Oh good.

72
00:03:25,865 --> 00:03:28,320
So how was the swimming lesson then?

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,850
OK, but you know, 8 o'clock on a Saturday
morning.

74
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,850
It's so early.

75
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:41,550
But at least you have the rest of the day
to do other things, like go to town with
your friends and shop for new clothes.

76
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,950
Oh Dad.

77
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,950
Anyway, how was it?

78
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,550
Well, there were three of us in the class.

79
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,750
The teacher told us to swim really fast
and gave a t-shirt to the winner of the
race.

80
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,350
And was it fun?

81
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,771
Yeah, actually.

82
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:58,050
I really like trying to win.

83
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,850
And I'm good, you know.

84
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,959
Yes, I know.

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,550
Your teacher told me.

86
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,550
I need a new swimming costume too.

87
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,037
Why?

88
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,550
What's wrong with the one you have?

89
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,750
It's a bit too small for me.

90
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:15,750
OK, so we'll go to the shops tomorrow and
get you a new one.

91
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,150
Now, where's your towel?

92
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,550
Oh, sorry Dad.

93
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,750
I think I left it in the changing room at
the pool.

94
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,550
Oh Susan, you're hopeless.

95
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:31,200
Hi Dad, I'm back.

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:31,945
Oh good.

97
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,400
So how was the swimming lesson then?

98
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,040
OK, but you know, 8 o'clock on a Saturday
morning.

99
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,940
It's so early.

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,640
But at least you have the rest of the day
to do other things like go to town with
your friends and shop for new clothes.

101
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
Oh Dad.

102
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,040
Anyway, how was it?

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,640
Well, there were three of us in the class.

104
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,840
The teacher told us to swim really fast
and gave a t-shirt to the winner of the
race.

105
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,440
And was it fun?

106
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,896
Yeah, actually.

107
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,240
I really like trying to win.

108
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,040
And I'm good, you know.

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,113
Yes, I know.

110
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,640
Your teacher told me.

111
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,040
I need a new swimming costume too.

112
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,589
Why?

113
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:14,640
What's wrong with the one you have?

114
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,840
It's a bit too small for me.

115
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,840
OK, so we'll go to the shops tomorrow and
get you a new one.

116
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,240
Now, where's your towel?

117
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Oh, sorry Dad.

118
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,640
I think I left it in the changing room at
the pool.

119
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,640
Oh Susan, you're hopeless.

120
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:40,570
Dad, can you give me a lift into town
tomorrow?

121
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,970
Yeah, I expect so.

122
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,170
Do you want to do some clothes shopping or
something?

123
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,170
No, I've got to get some earrings.

124
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:46,991
What more?

125
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,170
You've got so many.

126
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,911
No Dad, they're for Jenny.

127
00:05:49,911 --> 00:05:51,570
It's her birthday on Friday.

128
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,152
I see.

129
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:52,343
OK.

130
00:05:52,343 --> 00:05:54,570
Where do you want to get them from?

131
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,570
That little place opposite the bookshop.

132
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,170
You know, next to the chemist's.

133
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,570
Oh yes, I know.

134
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:00,620
Oh wait a minute.

135
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,770
I'm back late tomorrow.

136
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,970
I've got a meeting at three so I'll get
the 4.15 train.

137
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,970
So I should be back here at five.

138
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,970
But everything will be shut by then.

139
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,103
No, that's OK.

140
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,570
They stay open till six on Thursdays.

141
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,410
Dad?

142
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,810
I've got a meeting at three so I'll get
the 4.15 train.

143
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,810
So I should be back here at five.

144
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,810
But everything will be shut by then.

145
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,010
No, I've got to get some clothes shopping.

146
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,010
Oh, I've got to get some earrings.

147
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,900
What more?

148
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,210
You've got so many.

149
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,854
No Dad, they're for Jenny.

150
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,410
It's her birthday on Friday.

151
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:31,992
I see.

152
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:32,183
OK.

153
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,410
Where do you want to get them from?

154
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,610
That little place opposite the bookshop.

155
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,610
You know, next to the chemist's.

156
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,810
Oh yes, I know.

157
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,945
Oh wait a minute.

158
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,210
I'm back late tomorrow.

159
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,610
I've got a meeting at three so I'll get
the 4.15 train.

160
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,634
No, that's OK.

161
00:06:45,634 --> 00:06:47,810
They stay open till six on Thursdays.

162
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,796
Hello.

163
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:57,760
Can I help you?

164
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,413
Please.

165
00:06:58,413 --> 00:06:59,966
I'm looking for a hotel.

166
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,360
But I don't have much money to spend.

167
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,584
There are no hotels in this small village,
I'm afraid.

168
00:07:05,584 --> 00:07:06,760
Just people's houses.

169
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,560
In the next town, there's a big hotel on
the beach, but that's very expensive.

170
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,760
And there are some new villas there too,
overlooking the sea.

171
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,560
Are you travelling alone?

172
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:16,981
No.

173
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,307
I'm with a friend.

174
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:19,634
She's just coming.

175
00:07:19,634 --> 00:07:22,360
All we need is a room for a few days.

176
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,818
We can find you a room, no problem.

177
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,560
My job is to help tourists.

178
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,560
Look, that's my office over there.

179
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,042
OK.

180
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:33,560
So could you just tell me how much a room
costs?

181
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,596
Not too much.

182
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:35,560
About 20 euros.

183
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,322
What?

184
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,560
Per person?

185
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,878
No, for the room.

186
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:41,902
And if you stay for a week, it's even
cheaper.

187
00:07:41,902 --> 00:07:42,560
Maybe 120.

188
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,049
Oh, that sounds OK.

189
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,560
Have you got anything near the beach?

190
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,228
Yes.

191
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:51,560
I can find you something, no problem.

192
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,560
and then I can show you some places and
see if we can find you something that you
like.

193
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,557
Hello.

194
00:07:56,557 --> 00:07:58,550
Can I help you?

195
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,237
Please.

196
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:03,550
I'm looking for a hotel, but I don't have
much money to spend.

197
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,486
There are no hotels in this small village,
I'm afraid.

198
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,550
Just people's houses.

199
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,550
In the next town, there's a big hotel on
the beach, but that's very expensive.

200
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,550
And there are some new villas there too,
overlooking the sea.

201
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,550
Are you travelling alone?

202
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:17,932
No.

203
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:19,021
I'm with a friend.

204
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:20,111
She's just coming.

205
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:22,350
All we need is a room for a few days.

206
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,102
We can find you a room, no problem.

207
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:27,071
My job is to help tourists.

208
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:29,550
Look, that's my office over there.

209
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:29,981
OK.

210
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:33,750
So, could you just tell me how much a room
costs?

211
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,879
Not too much.

212
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,950
About 20 euros.

213
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,587
What?

214
00:08:36,587 --> 00:08:37,550
Per person?

215
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,821
No, for the room.

216
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:41,720
And if you stay for a week, it's even
cheaper.

217
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,350
Maybe 120.

218
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,975
Oh, that sounds OK.

219
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:46,750
Have you got anything near the beach?

220
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,238
Yes.

221
00:08:47,238 --> 00:08:49,902
I can find you something, no problem.

222
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:52,350
Look, we can wait for your friend.

223
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,619
And then I can show you some places.

224
00:08:54,619 --> 00:08:57,550
And see if we can find you something that
you like.

225
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
Can I return these ones, please?

226
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,564
Yes, certainly.

227
00:09:04,564 --> 00:09:05,381
Thank you.

228
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:07,340
Was there anything else?

229
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,707
Well, I ordered a book last week.

230
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:11,940
Can you check if it's arrived yet?

231
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,470
Sure.

232
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,909
Can I have your library card, please?

233
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,140
I just have to find your details on the
computer.

234
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:18,978
Sorry.

235
00:09:18,978 --> 00:09:22,380
The computer's being a bit slow.

236
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,980
That's all right.

237
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,154
No, sorry.

238
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:26,440
It's not here yet.

239
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,087
Oh.

240
00:09:27,087 --> 00:09:32,020
Also, do you have anything happening for
children this week?

241
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,542
Yes.

242
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,605
We have story time at 2pm this Friday.

243
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:37,620
It's for the under fives.

244
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,220
How much does it cost?

245
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,090
Oh, it's free for members.

246
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,420
And while that's on, mums and dads can
look around our exhibition of local
history.

247
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,704
That's great.

248
00:09:47,704 --> 00:09:50,291
We'll come back on Friday then.

249
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,960
Can I return these ones, please?

250
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,384
Yes, certainly.

251
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,201
Thank you.

252
00:09:55,201 --> 00:09:57,160
Was there anything else?

253
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,524
Well, I ordered a book last week.

254
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,960
Can you check if it's arrived yet?

255
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,490
Sure.

256
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,929
Can I have your library card, please?

257
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:08,160
I just have to find your details on the
computer.

258
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,966
Sorry.

259
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,200
The computer's being a bit slow.

260
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,800
That's all right.

261
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,934
No, sorry.

262
00:10:14,934 --> 00:10:16,220
It's not here yet.

263
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,667
Oh.

264
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:21,610
Also, do you have anything happening for
children this week?

265
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,144
Yes.

266
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:25,320
We have story time at 2pm this Friday.

267
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,410
It's for the under fives.

268
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,010
How much does it cost?

269
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,880
Oh, it's free for members.

270
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,210
And while that's on, mums and dads can
look around our exhibition of local
history.

271
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,296
That's great.

272
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,410
We'll come back on Friday then.

273
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,274
Good afternoon.

274
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:46,180
May I help you, madam?

275
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,393
Yes, please.

276
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:50,430
I'd like to go on holiday next week.

277
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,780
To the sunshine.

278
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,974
No problem.

279
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:54,780
Any country in mind?

280
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,580
Somewhere nice and warm, that's all.

281
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,380
How about this hotel in Egypt?

282
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,580
The weather's lovely right now.

283
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:07,780
That looks great, but a little expensive
for me, I think.

284
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,296
Hmm.

285
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:10,980
How about this apartment in Italy?

286
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,123
Tuscany.

287
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:14,600
That looks wonderful.

288
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,840
Can I go next week?

289
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,721
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:20,240
It's not available for another month.

291
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,512
Never mind.

292
00:11:21,512 --> 00:11:24,240
Anything in Spain or Greece?

293
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,925
There's this small hotel in Spain.

294
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:28,240
What do you think?

295
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,240
That looks great.

296
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,240
It's right on the beach.

297
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,240
And you can go next week.

298
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,293
Perfect.

299
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:37,640
And not too expensive.

300
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,640
No.

301
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,066
Then I'll take it.

302
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,040
Thanks so much for your help.

303
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,501
Good afternoon.

304
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,350
May I help you, madam?

305
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,562
Yes, please.

306
00:11:46,562 --> 00:11:49,600
I'd like to go on holiday next week.

307
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,950
To the sunshine.

308
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,144
No problem.

309
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,950
Any country in mind?

310
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:56,750
Somewhere nice and warm, that's all.

311
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,550
How about this hotel in Egypt?

312
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,750
The weather's lovely right now.

313
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:06,950
That looks great, but a little expensive
for me, I think.

314
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,466
Hmm.

315
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:10,150
How about this apartment in Italy?

316
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,265
Tuscany.

317
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:13,667
That looks wonderful.

318
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,840
Can I go next week?

319
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,721
I'm sorry.

320
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:19,240
It's not available for another month.

321
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,512
Never mind.

322
00:12:20,512 --> 00:12:23,240
Anything in Spain or Greece?

323
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,925
There's this small hotel in Spain.

324
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:27,240
What do you think?

325
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,640
That looks great.

326
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,440
It's right on the beach.

327
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,440
And you can go next week.

328
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,493
Perfect.

329
00:12:34,493 --> 00:12:36,840
And not too expensive.

330
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
No.

331
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,342
Then I'll take it.

332
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,440
Thanks so much for your help.

333
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,453
The first room is the kitchen.

334
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:51,050
It's quite small, but it has everything
you need.

335
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,902
There's a cooker and a small fridge.

336
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,950
And from the window you can see the
garden.

337
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,675
The sitting room is down here too.

338
00:12:59,675 --> 00:13:03,760
This is a much bigger room and very light
and comfortable.

339
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,340
Just through that door there is a
downstairs bathroom.

340
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,281
Outside the garden is very large.

341
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:15,184
And as you can hear, the area is very
peaceful.

342
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,260
There's no traffic noise.

343
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,912
Let's go upstairs.

344
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:21,332
Here you've got four bedrooms.

345
00:13:21,332 --> 00:13:25,850
They're nice and big and two of them have
got bathrooms.

346
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,373
The first room is the kitchen.

347
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:34,800
It's quite small, but it has everything
you need.

348
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,890
There's a cooker and a small fridge.

349
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,890
And from the window you can see the
garden.

350
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,732
The sitting room is down here too.

351
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:48,240
This is a much bigger room and very light
and comfortable.

352
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,790
Just through that door there is a
downstairs bathroom.

353
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,875
Outside the garden is very large.

354
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:59,984
And as you can hear, the area is very
peaceful.

355
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:02,170
There's no traffic noise.

356
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,592
Let's go upstairs.

357
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,628
Here you've got four bedrooms.

358
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:09,430
They're nice and big and two of them have
got bathrooms.

359
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,665
I'm a photographer.

360
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:21,820
I do a lot of work at home.

361
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,430
I usually get up at 6 o'clock and go for a
run.

362
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,430
When I get home, I have a shower and then
I eat breakfast.

363
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,940
At half past eight, my children go to
school and my wife leaves for work.

364
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,710
At 9 o'clock, I sit down at my computer
and start my work.

365
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,710
First, I read and send emails.

366
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,710
I advertise my photos on my website.

367
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:51,180
I make lots of people buy them from there.

368
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,470
At about 10.30, I take my camera and go
for a walk.

369
00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:00,690
I live in the country and there are a lot
of beautiful places to photograph.

370
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:03,820
I sometimes go for meetings in London.

371
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,140
On those days, I leave home early in the
morning.

372
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,940
I enjoy my job very much and I think I
always will.

373
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,842
I'm a photographer.

374
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:16,260
I do a lot of work at home.

375
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,520
I usually get up at 6 o'clock and go for a
run.

376
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,320
When I get home, I have a shower and then
I eat breakfast.

377
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:29,760
At half past eight, my children go to
school and my wife leaves for work.

378
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,340
At 9 o'clock, I sit down at my computer
and start my work.

379
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,340
First, I read and send emails.

380
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,340
I advertise my photos on my website and
lots of people buy them from there.

381
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,980
At about 10.30, I take my camera and go
for a walk.

382

I live in the country and there are a lot
of beautiful places to photograph.

383
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,490
I sometimes go for meetings in London.

384
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:59,590
On those days, I leave home early in the
morning.

385
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,910
I enjoy my job very much and I think I
always will.

386
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:12,360
This is Petra Harris with a programme
announcement.

387
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,060
On Wednesday evening, we have a special
programme from Africa.

388
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:23,190
Brian Williams is a reporter and he lived
there with a group of elephants for six
months.

389
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,220
This is his story.

390
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,410
There are some sad moments.

391
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,410
For example, when Jemma, a baby elephant,
dies.

392
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,410
But there are happy moments too.

393
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,480
We see the elephants in the water playing
like children.

394
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,480
It wasn't easy for Brian because the sun
was very strong and sometimes he didn't
have water.

395
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,480
He had a lot of help from the African
people.

396
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,480
One man, Charlie, was with him all the
time and is now his best friend.

397
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,480
So don't miss this programme.

398
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,280
Everyone who loves animals will enjoy it.

00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,280
