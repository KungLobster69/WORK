Is that right?
You more or less grew up in Canada?
Yes, till I was 16 or so, then we moved to Australia for a couple of years.
So were you born out there?
No, I was born in South Africa, and that's where we lived till I was about three, but I don't remember it.
So you're not really English at all?
Well, I am, but I only moved here when I started at university.

How reliable is your memory?
Pretty good, I think.
Why?
I was just reading about this new lie detector machine.
Apparently it's absolutely infallible and picks up any lie you tell without any hesitation.
And what's the connection with my memory?
Well, that's the thing.
It can work out you're not telling the truth, even if you actually don't know you're lying.
What?
You're confusing me.
You see, sometimes the memories of things that have happened to us, or that we've done, aren't always that reliable.
You know, I was convinced for years and years that I had actually witnessed a fire in our street when I was five.
I remember the panic, the sight of the flames leaping into the night sky.
I even remember the firemen shouting to each other.
And the heat.
I remember the heat, too.
What?
And it wasn't true?
Well, the fire happened.
It's just that it turned out I was nowhere near it at the time.
I was staying with my grandparents for the week, but people told me so much about it that I came to believe I'd seen it and built up all these false memories.
That's a bit scary, isn't it?

Have you tried that website I told you about yet?
The one with the vocabulary game?
Where they give some money to charity, if you get the answers right.
Yeah, it's good, isn't it?
Yes, I went on last night.
It's just so incredibly addictive, don't you think?
Tell me about it.
I was only going to stay on for a few minutes before tea, and an hour later I was still playing.
What level did you get to?
I think it was 47, but it's such a pain because if you just get one wrong, you go down a level and then it takes five correct answers to move back up again.
Well, I cheated.
I used a dictionary a couple of times.
Hey, that's not the idea.

Are you going to visit your sister in Italy again this year?
Well, I'd like to, but I don't think I can afford it.
But you wouldn't have to pay for a hotel, would you?
No, but I'll still have to pay for the flight and for everything else.
You might find a good deal on the internet, though.
I've found really cheap flights to Spain.
You're probably right, but I'd prefer to go when I've saved a bit more money.

What do you do when you go to France?
Do you go by ferry?
Yes, sometimes it's cheaper than hovercraft.
But how long did you say you were going for?
Just a couple of days, to Paris.
I wouldn't bother with that then, or the train.
I'd just get a cheap flight.

Yes, sometimes it's cheaper than half a craft.

I went to that new shopping centre last week.
You know the one, on London Road.
Oh, did you like it?
Yeah, it's not bad.
I expected it to be quite small, but it's not.
And the shops?
There are a lot, but most of them are a bit expensive for me.
What did you like the best?
There are some great cafes.
We had lunch in one of them.
Yeah?
The food was lovely, and it was quite cheap.
It sounds nice.
Maybe I'll go there next weekend.
What's it called?
Franco's, I think.
It's on the second floor.

So, Sarah, you've been a nurse for 35 years.
How do you feel now you're leaving?
Well, I'm looking forward to having a good rest, that's for sure.
I'm so happy I don't have to work during the night anymore.
Was it tiring doing nights?
Well, it was OK, and it was much nicer than having to do all these training courses.
Hmm.
And what will you do with all the free time you'll have in your retirement?
I don't know, but I hope I can find something where I feel useful.
So what will you miss?
Oh, I'll miss the patients, I suppose.
They were lovely.
Well, most of the time.
Yes, I can imagine.
But really, working with the other staff has been fantastic.
They, more than anything, made all my years here really special.
So will you come back and visit?
Definitely.

So, Sandy, what clothes are you packing for the festival this weekend?
Raincoats, jumpers, boots, the lot.
There's no room in my bags for food.
Really?
Do you think we'll need all that?
I was hoping for summer weather.
It is August after all.
Come on, Dave, look outside.
If it goes on like this, I'll really need all those things.
Yeah, I guess.
But the forecast says it'll clear up, be mostly dry and bright.
Hopefully they're right.
Oh, I hadn't seen the forecast.
Well, make sure you put in some lighter things.
Remember last year?
Oh yes, that sudden heat wave.
It was lovely.
But there you were, in all your winter clothes, much too hot and really uncomfortable.
Maybe you've got a point.
I'll put in a pair of shorts and a couple of T-shirts.
That's more like it.

I hear you've moved home.
Yes, last weekend, actually.
Did it all go well?
Yes, thanks.
But I was quite sad to say goodbye to the old flat.
I mean, I know it was rather small, but I really didn't need anything larger, and I got on quite well with the people next door.
But I suppose it's nice to get away from that part of the city.
Doesn't have a very good reputation, does it?
Actually, that didn't bother me, no.
The trouble was that I just couldn't afford the rent anymore.
Oh.
So what's your new place like then?
Well, the house itself is in quite good condition.
The landlord decorated it recently.
I have to say, some of it isn't really to my taste, but I can live with it.
There aren't any carpets, just wooden floors, which helps to make it seem clean.
And is there a garden?
Yes, but it's quite wild and I need to clear it very soon.
Well, tell me if I can do anything to help.
Oh, thanks for the offer.
I hear you've moved home.
Yes, last weekend, actually.

I can't decide which kitten I want, Dad.
Well, the lady said someone has bought this one with a black face, but the rest of them are available.
But I wanted a grey one like we saw at the farm.
None of these are grey.
No, but these are good house cats.
They live here in the lady's kitchen and her grandchildren play with them.
But I preferred the cat at the farm, Dad.
But that cat hasn't had much contact with humans, Lily.
It's been living in a barn, not a house, and the lady there said it might not be so good with children.
But look, these are very gentle, much nicer than the cat at the farm or the ones we saw at the pet shop, I think.
And the vets checked them and they're all healthy.
We could take one home today.
I suppose.
But couldn't we go back to see the grey one again and get a vet to check it?
OK, I'll tell you what we'll do.
I'll call the farm and see if they still have the grey kitten.
If no one's taken it, we'll go back and see it.
If it's gone, then we'll take one of these.
OK?
OK, Dad.
Thanks.

Good morning, everyone.
Well, it was a very successful weekend for Charlton High School sports teams.
On Saturday, our football team beat Milchester High School easily.
There were three goals from Fred Marks and one from Tom Barnes.
Milchester got one in the last minute, but the final result was 4-1 to us.
There was an important tennis match against Preston College on Sunday.
Elizabeth White won the girls' singles in a match that lasted from 10 to 11.30.
Unfortunately, we lost the boys' match.
But in the afternoon, the swimming teams were very successful.
There were wins for Helen Jakes and Gary Price.
Also on Sunday evening, we won the basketball match against Preston.
Well done, everyone.

The old part of the city also has some really lovely buildings.
Perhaps the most well-known is the beautiful Bay Hotel, which was built by the architect Anker Tyson.
There is also the Eagle Cinema.
Visitors don't just come for the films, they also come to admire the cinema itself, which is painted an amazing blue colour.
If the architecture doesn't interest you, then you might like to climb the Waterton Tower, It's nothing special to look at, but the views from the top are wonderful.
Finally, there is the Haddon Leisure Centre, with its fantastic modern design, where you can enjoy a number of different sports.

I met my best friend, Jessica, when we were five years old.
It was our very first day of school.
When we were children, we lived on the same street and spent every day together.
I always told her my problems and she always told me hers.
Now we're at different universities and live in different towns, but we phone or email every week.
Every summer, we travel together.
Last year we went to Italy.
I also visit her at home and she visits me.
I stayed in her house for a few days last month and she's going to come and see me next month.
I've got lots of new friends, but Jessica is the best.

This is Petra Harris with a programme announcement.
On Wednesday evening, we have a special programme from Africa.
Brian Williams is a reporter, and he lived there with a group of elephants for six months.
This is his story.
There are some sad moments.
For example, when Gemma, a baby elephant, dies.
But there are happy moments too.
We see the elephants in the water playing like children.
It wasn't easy for Brian because the sun was very strong and sometimes he didn't have water.
He had a lot of help from the African people.
One man, Charlie, was with him all the time and is now his best friend.
So don't miss this programme.
Everyone who loves animals will enjoy it.
Wednesday evening, 8.30 on Channel 6.

Hi Masako, this is Eva.
Thanks for your message and for worrying about me.
I do feel quite ill actually.
I've got a really bad cold and I don't feel like doing anything, just staying in bed and resting.
I saw the doctor yesterday.
He gave me a prescription for some medicine and I've got an appointment to see him again the day after tomorrow.
I left a message with the college secretary to say why I'm not there, but could you do me a favour?
I should be OK to come back to class after the weekend, but I'm worried because I'm missing a lot of lessons, and we've got that test at the end of next week.
So, when the teacher gives you exercises in class, could you ask her for a copy of them for me?
Thanks very much.
Oh, and thanks for saying you'll do some shopping for me, but my sister's going to get some things for me tomorrow.
Just bread, fruit, milk and so on.
So I'll be able to manage okay.
I hope to speak to you soon though.
Bye.
